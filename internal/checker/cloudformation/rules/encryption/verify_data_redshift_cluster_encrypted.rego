# METADATA
# title: "Verify data stored in Redshift cluster are encrypted"
# description: "This policy recommends securely encrypting all data stored in the Redshift cluster at rest. You can achieve this by either creating new encrypted clusters or enabling CMK encryption on existing clusters. AWS suggests enabling encryption during cluster creation or modifying unencrypted clusters to use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) encryption."
