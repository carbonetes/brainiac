# METADATA
# title: "Verify all ElastiCache Replication Group data is encrypted in transit with authentication tokens."
# description: "Authentication becomes feasible solely during the creation of clusters with in-transit encryption activated. With Redis authentication enabled, users are obliged to pass through an extra authentication layer to access the server. It is advisable to ensure secure encryption of all data within the ElastiCache Replication Group during transit by utilizing an authentication token."
