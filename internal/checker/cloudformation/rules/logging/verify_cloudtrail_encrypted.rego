# METADATA
# title: "Verify Cloudtrail logs are encrypted at rest"
# description: "AWS CloudTrail documents AWS API calls, accessible per IAM policies. AWS KMS manages encryption keys with HSMs. CloudTrail logs use SSE and KMS CMKs for security. Configure CloudTrail with SSE-KMS for added confidentiality. Users need S3 read permission and CMK decryption rights for log access."
