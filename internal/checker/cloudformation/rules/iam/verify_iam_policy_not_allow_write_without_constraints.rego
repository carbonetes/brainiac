# title: "Verify write access for IAM policies is not allowed without constraints"
# description: "This policy grants permissions for actions capable of modifying resource-based policies or potentially exposing AWS resources to the public. Such actions have the potential to inadvertently reveal resources through similar operations, thus posing a risk of resource exposure."
