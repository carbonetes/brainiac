# METADATA
# title: "Verify no open access to back-end through API"
# description: "This policy underscores that AWS API Gateway methods are initially public. To safeguard against data leaks and security breaches, all methods in the API Gateway should be protected by an Authorizer or an API key. It's recommended to configure a custom authorizer or an API key for each method to bolster security."
