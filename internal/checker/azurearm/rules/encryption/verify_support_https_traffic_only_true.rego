# METADATA
# title: "Verify HTTPS only allowed if supportsHttpsTrafficOnly is true"
# description: "This policy recommends enforcing secure transfer for all storage accounts, ensuring that Azure Storage REST API operations are exclusively conducted over HTTPS. It also advises configuring Azure Blob storage to accept requests only from secure connections by enabling the Secure Transfer Required property. This ensures that any requests originating from insecure connections are rejected."
