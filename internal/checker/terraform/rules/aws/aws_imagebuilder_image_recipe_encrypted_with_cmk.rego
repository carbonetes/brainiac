# METADATA
# title: "Confirm that the Image Recipe EBS Disks are CMK encrypted"
# description: "In accordance with this policy, Image Recipe EBS Disks that use default KMS keys rather than customer-managed keys for encryption are identified. To encrypt your EFS data, it is recommended that you utilize customer-managed KMS Keys. You are granted total control on the encrypted data."
