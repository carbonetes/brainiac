# METADATA
# title: "See to it that the Neptune Cluster instance is not accessible to the general public"
# description: "With Neptune, you can also take database snapshots that you can later utilize to recover a database from. An owner of the recipient account can use the snapshot you share with them to restore a database that contains your data. You can share a snapshot with another Amazon Web Services account. A database holding your data can be restored by anyone if you decide to make your snapshots public."
