# title: "Make certain that the security groups for Amazon EMR clusters are closed to the world"
# description: "Making guaranteed that the security groups for your Amazon EMR clusters are not accessible to the worldÂ is normally a wise security move. As outside parties won't be able to connect to them via the internet, this can aid in protecting your EMR clusters from unwanted access."
